        <strong>One of the most recognized horse breeds in the world</strong> , the Friesian is known for its luxurious pitch-black coat, feathered legs and breathtaking action. 
        Developed in the Friesland province of the Netherlands around the 16th century, the breed gradually found its way through the world, becoming famous in the process. 
        Today, if a movie has horses in it, nine times out of 10 there’s a Friesian. But it’s not just their looks that make them great Hollywood stars. 
        The breed is intelligent, athletic and willing to work—all things a good star should be.

       <h2>
             1. Friesian horses are named after their origination province. 
        </h2>
       <p>
        Friesland is where the Friesian horse originates. It’s a northern province in The Netherlands, situated along the North Sea. It is a mostly rural province, known for its agricultural activities. Less than 4% of the population of The Netherlands calls this province their home. 
        </p>
        <h2>
             2. It is an ancient breed.
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Friesian horse has been around for nearly 1,000 years. The first documents which appear to discuss this breed and its positive qualities have been dated to before the year 1200. King Louis II, who was the ruler of Hungary, is often described as riding a Friesian horse into battle in the mid-1500s. Ancestors of the modern Friesian horse are even said to have been used in the medieval period because they could effectively carry knights and nobility into battle. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            3.  Friesians have been in the United States since its colonial days. 
       </h2>
       <p>
        The first imports to North America for Friesian horses occurred in the 1600s, immediately after colonies were established. The Dutch controlled the early areas around what is now New York and they imported their “trotters” to help tame the lands so that agricultural activities could occur as effectively as possible in those early days.
       </p>
       <h2>
            4.  Friesian horses are often black, but they have other coats as well. 
   </h2>
   <p>
    Most people picture the Friesian horse as a pure black horse. This is because Friesian horses in other coat colors are not able to be registered. Chestnut coats are also available with this horse breed and no stallions with this coloration are allowed to register. Some geldings and mares are given exceptions to this rule if all other conformation aspects are of a superior quality.
   </p>
   <h2>
             5. Chestnut or Bay Friesians are called “Fire” horses. 
</h2>
<p>
    Chestnut stallions, as well as rejected mares and geldings, are eligible to register under a separate registry. These horses are called “Fire Friesians” and their registry is maintained by the Friesian Heritage Horse and Sporthorse International registry.

            Arabians are <strong>one of the oldest and most beautiful horse breeds in the world</strong>. Native to the Arabian Peninsula, they are famous for their unique dished heads, high tail carriage, and remarkable intelligence.
            Arabians are also one of only three hot-blooded horse breeds in the world, characterized by speed, stamina, and a spirited nature.
            Over the course of history, Arabian Horses have reached every corner of the world. Due to their beauty and versatility, they have become one of the most popular horse breeds on the planet. Arabians have even made it into Hollywood and were featured in famous movies such as The Black Stallion.
            Arabian Horses are typically lightweight, with lean muscles and tendons like steel made for endurance. They are relatively small horses, standing only 14.1 to 15.1 hands. Today, the breed is most often used as a show, sport, and pleasure riding horse.

       <h2>
             1. Arabians Are One of the Oldest Horse Breeds in the World
        </h2>
       <p>
                The available archeological evidence suggests that the history of Arabian Horses dates back to at least 4,500 years ago. While the breed’s exact origins are obscure, modern Arabians are thought to be the descendants of the ancient “Proto-Arabian”.
                Horses resembling the typical Arabian appear on numerous inscriptions and rock paintings of the Arabian Peninsula from 3,500 years ago. They were also featured in the artwork of Ancient Egypt dating back to the 16th century BC.
                These and other pieces of evidence prove that Arabian Horses have been the loyal partners of humans for thousands of years.

             2. Most Modern Horse Breeds Have Arabian Bloodlines
        </h2>
        <p>
                Being one of the oldest breeds means that Arabian Horses have influenced many modern horse breeds. In fact, if we traced pedigrees back far enough, we would find that most breeds today have some Arabian blood running through their veins.
                In the past, horse breeders all over the world used Arabian Horses to refine their current stock. Arabian blood was known to add speed, stamina, and strong bone to the recipient breed.

            3. They are one of the most popular horse breeds in the world
       </h2>
       <p>
        It is no surprise that the Arabian Horse are among the most popular horse breeds in the world. Once confined to the desert lands of Saudi Arabia, they have now conquered the world with large populations living on most continents.
        According to the World Arabian Horse Organization (WAHO), there were over one million Arabians living in 62 countries in 2014.
        Over than half of the world’s population (663,833) resided in the United States, followed by Canada (48,010). Moreover, large numbers of Arabian Horses are found in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.

       <h2>
            4. The Bedouin People Shared Their Homes With Arabian Horses
   </h2>
   <p>
    For thousands of years, Arabians lived among the desert tribes of the Arabia Peninsula. The tribe that originally developed the Arabian Horse breed was the Beduins. 
    They meticulously bred the best horses and treated them as part of their families.The Beduin people maintained a rigorous breeding program to ensure their horses were of the purest breeding. They selectively bred for alertness, speed, and stamina, qualities that were essential in raiding and war. The Beduins regarded Arabians so highly that they even shared their tents with their horses.

   <h2>
             5. There Are Various Types Of Arabian Horses
</h2>
<p>
    Although the Arabian is one uniform breed, various types of Arabian Horses developed over time. For centuries, the purest Arabian bloodlines were referred to as the “Bedouin strain”, but this is no longer the case. As several countries began their own Arabian breeding programs, many breed types bear the name of their home country.
    The most popular type of Arabians today are the Egyptian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Shagya, Domestic and Crabbet. The Shagya Arabians were developed in Hungary, while the Domestic type originates in the United States. Crabbet Arabians descent from the pure Arabian Horses of Lady Ann Blunt, who imported the horses to England.

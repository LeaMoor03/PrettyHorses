        Marwari horses, also referred to as Malani horses, are a unique breed of horse that are found in Marwari, a part of India which is also referred to as Jodhpur. 
        These horses have a number of interesting features, perhaps the most well-known being their ears which turn inwards at the tops. This gives the horses their <strong>characteristic appearance</strong>.

       <h2>
             1. The Marwari Horse can be considered a pony.
        </h2>
       <p>
        Marwari horses have become one of the most popular breeds of horses across the world because of their unique appearance, their intelligence, and their strength. However, there’s one thing that horse breeders may not always tell people about the Marwari: it’s not always considered a horse.


        </p>
        <h2>
             2. Marwari Horses Have Fascinating History.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Marwari horses are actually descended from war horses that were used during the earlier days of India.
            In the northwest India, there is an area close to the Khyber Pass in Pakistan. Here was the place that southern Asia was connected to the northern regions, and as such this was a very popular place for invasion. They were used as cavalry horses by the Rajputs, the people of this area because they was a very loyal and brave breed of horse.
            The Rajputs defended this area diligently for over two centuries, and their deeds along with the beautiful horses that helped them accomplish their guardianship were recorded in stories, songs, and poems.  
        </p>
        <h2>
            3. There’s a Reason These Horses are Rare.
       </h2>
       <p>
        Marwari horses are pretty rare on the Indian subcontinent, but they’re even more rare in the rest of the world.
        The main reason for this is because these horses have been banned for export for most of their existence. 
        There was a few years – between the years 2000 and 2006 – that the horse was legal for export. 
        However, only a few were sent out of the country during these years, so breeding of Marwari horses outside the world is extremely uncommon.  
        In 2008, a law was passed that allowed these horses to travel internationally for set amounts of time.
       </p>
       <h2>
            4. Marwari are Used for Religious Purposes.
   </h2>
   <p>
            Marwari have been used for religious ceremonies for many hundreds of years in India, and they are still used to some degree. However, due to the following of tradition, only White Marwaris are used for religious reasons.
            Interestingly, while the white horses are used for religious purposes, they are generally not accepted into Marwari stud books. For this, grey horses are considered among the most beautiful and valuable, with piebald and skewbald being the second most popular.
            In a somewhat religious or superstitious fashion, black Marwari horses are considered to be unlucky much in the same way that black cats are. Black is a color associated with death and decay, and some people find these traits undesirable.
   </p>
   <h2>
             5. Marwari Breeding Practices Are Important.
</h2>
<p>
    For hundreds of years, the Marwari breed has been carefully taken care of. 
    Ever since the days of the Rajput warriors who wanted to breed them for strength and loyalty, up until today, where they are bred for their beauty and intelligence.
    Strict breeding practices have been observed since the horses were first bred over 800 years ago. In 1995, a Marwari breeding society was opened to help preserve purity among the Marwari.
